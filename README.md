# My New Website & Project Portfolio

This is a starter template for a personal website and project portfolio, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages. It's set up to help you showcase your web app projects.

## Structure

- `index.html`: The main landing page of your site. Edit this to introduce yourself and list your projects.
- `css/style.css`: Main stylesheet for your website. Customize it to match your personal brand.
- `js/script.js`: Main JavaScript file for any global interactivity on your site.
- `projects/`: This directory is where you'll place your individual web app projects.
    - Each project should ideally reside in its own subdirectory (e.g., `projects/my-first-app/`).
    - Each project should have its own `index.html` (or equivalent entry point).

## How to Add a New Project

1.  **Create a Project Folder:**
    Inside the `projects/` directory, create a new folder for your project (e.g., `my-awesome-app`).
    ```
    projects/
    └── my-awesome-app/
        ├── index.html
        ├── app.js
        └── style.css
        └── ... (other project files)
    ```

2.  **Develop Your Project:**
    Place all the files for your web app project (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, assets, etc.) into this new folder.

3.  **Link to Your Project from the Main Page:**
    Open the main `index.html` file (in the root directory). Find the `<section id="projects-list">`. You can add a "project card" or a simple link to your new project. For example:

    ```html
    <!-- Add this inside the <div class="project-grid"> in index.html -->
    <div class="project-card">
        <h3>My Awesome App</h3>
        <p>A short description of what this app does.</p>
        <a href="projects/my-awesome-app/index.html">View Project</a>
    </div>
    ```

## Customization

-   **Styling:** Modify `css/style.css` to change the look and feel of your site.
-   **Content:** Edit `index.html` to update the main page content, your introduction, etc.
-   **JavaScript:** Add any global JavaScript functionality to `js/script.js`.

## Hosting on GitHub Pages

This template is ready to be deployed on GitHub Pages.

1.  **Push to GitHub:**
    Commit all these files to your GitHub repository (e.g., `your-username.github.io` or any other repository).

2.  **Configure GitHub Pages (if not already set up):**
    -   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    -   Click on "Settings".
    -   Navigate to the "Pages" section in the left sidebar.
    -   Under "Build and deployment", for "Source", select "Deploy from a branch".
    -   Choose the branch you pushed your code to (e.g., `main` or `master`).
    -   For the folder, select `/ (root)`.
    -   Click "Save".

Your website should be live at `https://your-username.github.io/your-repository-name/` (or `https://your-username.github.io/` if it's a user/organization site).

## Erasing Old Files

As requested, this template structure is intended to replace your existing website files. When you commit and push these new files to your repository, they will overwrite or remove any old files that are not part of this new structure, effectively "erasing" them. Ensure you have backed up anything important from your old site if needed, though you mentioned they aren't needed.

## Next Steps

-   Personalize `index.html` with your information.
-   Customize `css/style.css` to your liking.
-   Start adding your web app projects to the `projects/` directory!

Happy coding!

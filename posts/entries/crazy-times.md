# Do you know what wiby is?

<p>I found this search engine called wiby.me. It seems to only indexes websites without javascript making it feel like the internet from the 90's.</p>
<br>
<p>It's a bit nostalgic, but also sad. Seeing personal websites about very specific topics will never happen again. With the rise of AI answers, there is almost no need to visit a website to get information. Even people like me who actively seek out these spaces have a hard time finding them.</p>
